<p>All the information about transactions involving your funds/credits.</p>
<p>So, all your wallet top-ups/deposits, payments and refunds, and all actions performed by external plugins that change your credit balance.</p>
<p>Moreover, your current balance is saved.</p>
<p>During the creation of the order, we will store the meta fields related to the funds used (whenever you pay using your credits) or the funds youâ€™ve been credited (whenever you top up your account). These fields, so, are subject to WooCommerce plugin Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>The plugin sends two emails to the user.</p>
<p>The first one is sent every time the credit balance goes below a given threshold and invites users to top up the account.</p>
<p>The second one is sent every time the admin applies changes to the credit balance from the backend.</p>
