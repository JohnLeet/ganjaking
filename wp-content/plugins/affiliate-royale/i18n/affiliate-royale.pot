When you use static values like this you have to omit the order_id. Since the order_id must be unique, Affiliate Royale automatically creates a unique order_id for you -- this means that you'll want to probably disable the \"Affiliate Commission Notification\" and prevent your thank you page from being refreshed when using this method. This is because Affiliate Royale will track each page load as a new affiliate transaction."
