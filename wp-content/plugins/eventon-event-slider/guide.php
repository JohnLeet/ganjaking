<h4>How to add an event slider</h4>
<p>Event Slider is generated via shortcode</p>
<p>Go to the page (edit) where you want to insert the eventON slider and open eventon shortcode generator -- http://www.myeventon.com/documentation/shortcode-generator/ in there you should find an option for event slider. Click on that and select desired shortcode options and insert the shortcode into the page. Save changes and now you should be able to see the slider where you have inserted this shortcode.
