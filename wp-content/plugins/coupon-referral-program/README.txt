Install the coupon referral program on your store to reward your customers on signups and referral purchases

== Description ==

Referral marketing is one of the best marketing methods for online stores as marketers can use their existing customers’ recommendations and word of mouth for product promotion. Referral systems work so well because people trust the product recommendations and suggestions of their friends or family over any form of advertising. Also, It helps online stores to earn loyal customers, improve customer engagement and increase sales.

* **Decide The Discount Amount You Want To Provide:** Specify the coupon amount you want to provide on sign-up and referral purchase.

It can also be customized using the predefined option present in the Display Configuration (i.e. button text, color, position, and background image of the button that will be visible to guest users.)

* **Coupon Reporting:** Coupon Reporting can be performed from the admin and customer end to acquire coupon information. Through Coupon Reporting, it’s easy to analyze coupon utilization and its effectiveness for users. Businesses can further use this report to analyze and improve their promotional strategies.

* **Coupon Expiration Time:** Enter the days after which no one can use their rewarded coupon. Set ‘0’ if you want your coupon to be redeemable forever. [Note- The referral link can be used even after the inserted date has gone but the referred won’t get any discount coupon for the same.]
