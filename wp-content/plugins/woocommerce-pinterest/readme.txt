== The major plugin features: ==

**Adding the Rich Pins markup to the product page**

The plugin also adds the necessary Open Graph markup to the product page so that it is validated by Pinterest and all the necessary data is transferred automatically.

**Adding pins to your Pinterest account from the WordPress dashboard**

The plugin allows you to choose images on the adding / editing product page, that will be pinned in your Account on Pinterest. Together with the product image, all the data provided by Rich Pins are also transferred: the name, description, price, availability.

**The ability to set up an automatic creation of a pin description based on product shortcodes**

The ability to transfer not only the product description to the pin description but to form a template based on shortcodes with the help of which the additional product data such as the product price, name, URL, description, short description and site name will be transferred to Pinterest.

**Adding multiple pins to the ‘All products’ page**

The ability to choose all products, that you need to be posted on Pinterest. The main product image will be used for a pin.

**Updating pins after updating a product**

If you change any product data (of the products presented on Pinterest) in the WooCommerce dashboard – price, description, name, or tick additional product images, all pins will automatically be added to the queue for updating on Pіnterest.

**Bulk updating of the added pins**

This feature allows you to make bulk updating of the created pins from the WordPress dashboard. Thus, you can quickly update products’ price, description, and name in all pins.

**Adding additional product photos**

This feature provides you the ability to add to your Pinterest account not only the main photo but also all the additional photos.

**Track conversions with Pinterest Tag**

We've added the ability to integrate Pinterest Tag into your online store. The Pinterest tag allows you to track actions people take on your website after viewing your Promoted Pin. You can use this information to measure return on ad spend (RoAS) and create audiences to target on your Promoted Pins.
